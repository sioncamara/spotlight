## Pausing the project once more useful to myself than what I could find on the market

At least that's the future potential of this application, for now it's just going that for myself.

I've put a pause in this side project since it became too much of a time commitment. I build the application to the point where it's peronsally more useful to me that other solutions
on the market. Instead of trying to build enough funtionality to where it's intutive for anyone to use, I've decided to use what I build to read books in a more enjoyable manner on the weekends.

So while the core funtionality of an application is here it, cannot be used without some instruction and Gotchas. I would like to provide some context of the technology used and the complexity of the engineering work involved.

## The easy part

The easy part of this application is the most clear to see when visiting the website. Namely, uploading a pdf and it being saved to ones library (specific to browser being used)
with a neat 3d book cover made in part possible through this open source project: [3d book cover](https://github.com/scastiel/book-cover-3d).
The hardest part about this was figuring out how to convert the first page of an uploaded pdf file to an image:

```jsx
export async function getCoverImage(page: PDFPageProxy): Promise<string> {
  var scale = 1.5
  var viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: scale })

  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas")
  const context = canvas.getContext("2d")
  if (!context) throw new Error("Error generating canvas context")

  canvas.width = viewport.width
  canvas.height = viewport.height

  const renderContext = {
    canvasContext: context,
    viewport: viewport,
  }

  return page
    .render(renderContext)
    .promise.then(() => {
      const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL("image/png")
      return dataURL
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      throw error
    })
}
```

## The harder part

Getting the pdf to display in a resizable maner with features relevant to reading was a lot harder.
I read a considerable portion of [react-pdf](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/tree/main/packages/react-pdf) source code to gain a deep enough understanding of how to use their
provided callback functions in a manner to do things as saving the cover of a pdf as an image, saving the most recent page the user has visit, provide a user with a handy table of contents
popover that whords when hovering over the eyeclass icon, which I made using figma, using [react window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) to only render a limited number of pdf pages at a time,
leading to the user experience of the pdf having almost no load times when rendering.

## The hardest part is most unoticable

Ufortuantely, at this point in time in order for the application to read out loud to the user while highliting the current word and sentence
one has to use microsoft's edge browser and be familiar with their read aloud feature. In addition when I was after implementing react window for faster load times it broke some of
of ede's read aloud feature's functioanlity, specifically when one starts reading they have to double tap on a word to see the highlighting functionality to work. While usuing
the assistive technology is currenently unintuitive when it is used properly it leads to an assistive reading experience that is in my opinion better than what's availble on the market
most notably speechify and natural reader.

Argubly the hardest part about all of this wasn't the enggierning work--though this was challenging and a fantastic learning experience--the hardest point was figuring out how to effectively
highlight text on a pdf as flawlessly as the best software available without hardly any information on the internet on how to do this. It took me about a month of trying out different
hypothesis here and there.

I believe figuring out how to do this demonstrates a very high level of perceverance towards a technical challenge of interest.
