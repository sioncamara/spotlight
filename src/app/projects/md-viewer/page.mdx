This is the simples of the projects mentioned on this website, but does a great job of a capacity to imporove developer experience, 
which I have also done for the team I work on at Target.

I build this because I was using a generic markdown editor for this purposes and was getting frustrated
by the hundreds of clicks I was doing a day to listen to responses and desired to reduce them significnatly,
 which I successfuly did.

The primary purposes of this project is to take a response from a chatbot within the <ExternalLink href="https://www.cursor.com/" content="cursor IDE" />.

After copying a response, I will go to the md application and use mircosoft edge's in build <ExternalLink href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/read-aloud?form=MA13FJ" content="read aloud feature" />
to listen to the response.

I set up the application on initial page load and refresh take whatever is in the users clip board for less clicks.
This allows me to replace the current content with two commands (command + r, command + shift + u).

I'll often find myself asking a chatbot questions about two seperate topics,
and will listen to the response for one topic while the chatbot generates the response
for the question I just asked about the other topic.

This application has allowed me to better harness the new capabilities of chatbots
primarly leading to much faster rates of learning what I don't know and being made aware
of things that are important that I didn't even know I didn't know.

Take two: 
This application has allowed me to better harness the new capabilities of chatbots
to improve my skills as a front-end developer at a rate previsouly not possible.
